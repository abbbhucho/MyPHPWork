This method is the oldest that is to send the POST/GET request via XMLHTTPRequest calling it via creating a new ajax function and sending data via this function 
<h5>var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();</h5>
This method is sending it from scratch without the use of Ajax Libraries .It is a bit less secure and the GET method is susceptive to external attacks
